# PENDART
Brilliant African artists in less privileged areas sell their
valuable Art for so little. What if they could have access to an
international market without resellers taking advantage of their
work? PendArt allows its users to purchase unique African arts
directly from the artist.

## Tools used : React Native
See the deployed App [PendArt](https://dashnewsmads.herokuapp.com/)
